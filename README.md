# PhD Programme Task Manager (CLI Version)

A simple command-line interface (CLI) task manager designed to help PhD students organize, track, and manage their PhD tasks effectively.  
The application stores tasks in an SQLite database and supports adding, viewing, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks, with visual indicators for task completion and overdue status.

## Features

- Add new tasks with description, deadline, priority, progress, and completion status.
- View all tasks sorted by deadline and priority.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit task details and update progress.
- Delete tasks.
- Search and filter tasks by keyword, completion status, and overdue status.
- Overdue tasks are clearly marked in red.
- Stores data persistently using a local SQLite database (`tasks.db`).

* Overdue tasks (past their deadline and not completed) will be highlighted in red for easy identification.
